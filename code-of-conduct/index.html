						<h2 class="module-title font-alt">Definition &amp; Scope</h2>
						<div>
							<ul>
								<li>
									A <i>“Buspreneur”</i> is a participant in a StartupBus event that by successfully participating in an annual competition, has been admitted into the StartupBus community.
								</li>
								<li>
									A <i>"Conductor"</i> and/or <i>“Producer”</i> of StartupBus is also considered a member of the community but in a community leadership role.
								</li>
								<li>
									This policy applies for conduct at the annual competition as well as for lifetime membership in the community and handles the following domains:
									<ol>
										<li>Anti-Harassment</li>
										<li>Intellectual Property</li>
										<li>Common Courtesy</li>
										<li>Expulsion from an Event</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li>
									In case of emergency and/or unavailability of local staff members, please contact any of our Directors (directors @ startupbus.com) or the global leadership (Elias Bizannes, Founder/CEO, elias @ startupbus.com; Mitch Neff, Global Director, mitch @ startupbus.com).
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div>

						<h2 class="module-title font-alt">Anti-Harassment</h2>
						<div>
							The Buspreneur Code of Conduct has been adopted from the <a href="http://hackcodeofconduct.org" target="_blank">Hack Code of Conduct</a>.
						</div>
						<h3>The Quick Version</h3>
						<div>
							StartupBus is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, previous hackathon attendance or computing experience (or lack of any of the aforementioned). We do not tolerate harassment of buspreneurs in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any venue, including hacks, talks, workshops, parties, social media and other online media. Buspreneurs violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from StartupBus without a refund (if applicable) at the discretion of the organisers StartupBus.
						</div>
						<h3>The Less-Quick Version</h3>
						<div>
							<p>
								Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, or religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
							</p>
							<p>
								Photography is encouraged, but other participants must be given a reasonable chance to opt out from being photographed. If they object to the taking of their photograph, comply with their request. It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy (in bathrooms or where participants are sleeping).
							</p>
							<p>
								Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
							</p>
							<p>
								As StartupBus is partly a hackathon, we like to explicitly note that the products created during StartupBus are equally subject to the anti-harassment policy.
							</p>
							<p>
								Sponsors and partners of StartupBus are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Sponsor representatives (including volunteers) should not use sexualised lothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of StartupBus staff immediately.
							</p>
							<p>
								StartupBus staff will be happy to help participants contact any local security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the StartupBus. We value your attendance.
							</p>
							<p>
								If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the StartupBus organisers may take any action they deem appropriate. This includes warning the offender, expulsion from StartupBus with no refund (if applicable), or reporting their behaviour to local law enforcement.
							</p>
							<p>
								We expect participants to follow these rules at StartupBus and workshop venues and StartupBus related social events.
							</p>
							<p>
								If the matter is especially urgent or a local staff member is unavailable, please contact any of our Directors – all reports are confidential. To the entire group, directors @ startupbus.com or to the global leadership:
								<ul>
									<li>Elias Bizannes (Founder/CEO) at elias @ startupbus.com</li>
									<li>Mitchell Neff (Global Director) at mitch @ startupbus.com</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
						</div>

						<h2 class="module-title font-alt">Intellectual Property</h2>
						<div>
							<p>
								In the interest of fairplay, you agree to not take any idea pitched at a StartupBus event and
								<ol>
									<li>
										actively pursue it without the consent of person/team that originated the idea; and/or
									</li>
									<li>
										make any moves or attempts to register any intellectual property originating from another team for a period of twelve (12) months after the conclusion of the event in which the idea was pitched.
									</li>
								</ol>
							</p>
							<p>
								Examples would include but are not limited to:
								<ul>
									<li>
										Using another team’s idea in a subsequent hack-a-thon or event
									</li>
									<li>
										Moving to register a team’s name as your own product name, either on your own or with a third party
									</li>
									<li>
										Co-opting or copying an idea pitched on StartupBus and releasing or attempting to release it as your own, or assisting someone else in doing the same.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<p>
								StartupBus works on collaboration. There is a certain element of trust that should be implied from the start. This agreement states that you will not take someone else’s idea and try to beat them to market with it.
							</p>
							<p>
								Conversely, if someone has a great idea that was used in a StartupBus competition and does nothing with it for a period of twelve (12) months following, it should be considered fairplay for the idea originator to release any moral claims of ownership.
							</p>
							<p>
								Regardless, you agree to make every effort to work with the originator and let them know your intentions.
							</p>
						</div>

						<h2 class="module-title font-alt">Common Courtesy</h2>
						<div>
							<p>
								Participants will be held responsible for vandalism or any other damage that occurs in their rooms or host spaces during the event. Rowdiness in the hallways, excessive noise, roughhousing, throwing objects, accessing prohibited areas of the hotel/event premises, and/or other unruly behavior will not be tolerated.
							</p>
							<p>
								The organizers reserve the right to eject participants for these or other disruptions to the safety and well-being of other guests, participants and/or the general public.
							</p>
						</div>

						<h2 class="module-title font-alt">Expulsion from an Event</h2>
						<div>
							<p>
								The Directors of StartupBus reserve the right to expel any participant from the event at any time for violating or failing to comply with event regulations and policies. Expulsions take effect immediately.
							</p>
							<p>
								In addition, the violator will be sent home at his or her own expense and no refund will be issued. The other participants from the participant’s team could be disqualified as well.
							</p>
							<p>
								Violations of the Buspreneur Code of Conduct will be grounds for immediate removal and relinquishment of awards and recognition.
